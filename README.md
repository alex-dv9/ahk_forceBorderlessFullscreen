You must install AutoHotKey 1.1 to use this script.
Usage guide:
1. Enter your game (or games) names(s) on line 3. Use AutoHotKey Window Spy provided installed by default to get this name(s).
2. Enter your monitor width and height +14 (to both) on line 14 of the script. By default it's configured to be used with 1920x1080 monitor.
3. Run script and launch your game. You will hear three beeps. First one indicates that game was successfully detected and will be launched right after script detects your game. Second one indicates that your game's window size and style were changed and, like these changes, runs after 10 seconds after game launch detection. Last one indicates that supported game was closed.
